      <p>Wynter's Dreams</p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Duration</h2>
      <p>August 2023 - March 2024</p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Role</h2>
      <p>Backend Developer</p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        Wynter's Dreams is an interactive platform designed to bring children's books to life. The website allows users
        to explore stories where each page can lead to different paths, creating a dynamic reading experience. I worked
        on the backend, developing robust systems for user creation and management, and built an admin dashboard where
        administrators can easily upload and manage books, blogs, and testimonials. To support the interactive nature of
        the books, each page is stored in a JSON object format, allowing seamless navigation through the story. This
        project highlights my expertise in backend development, focusing on user management and dynamic content
        delivery.
      </p>

      <h1 class="section-heading">Architecture & Design</h1>
      <h2 class="section-subheading">Overview</h2>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="rendered/overview.svg" alt="Wynter's Dreams Architecture Overview" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The architecture of Wynter's Dreams emphasizes scalability, security, and efficiency to provide a seamless
        interactive experience. The backend, built in Go, handles core functionalities such as user management and
        content delivery, leveraging Go’s performance and concurrency.
      </p>
      <p>
        PostgreSQL manages metadata for books, blogs, and users, while Amazon S3 stores book content, images, and JSON
        objects. This separation ensures efficient data handling and high performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        User authentication uses a simple username and password, with authorization handled by PASETO tokens for secure
        access control. A load balancer with TLS termination routes traffic to backend services and manages SSL
        certificates, ensuring encrypted data transfer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The frontend communicates with the backend via REST APIs, accessing metadata from PostgreSQL and content from S3
        to deliver an engaging user experience. This setup supports robust and flexible growth with minimal disruption.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Scalability & Performance</h2>
      <p>
        Wynter's Dreams is designed for high performance and scalability. The backend, built in Go, utilizes its strong
        concurrency features to efficiently handle multiple requests through lightweight goroutines, ensuring fast and
        reliable processing.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="rendered/scalability.svg" alt="Wynter's Dreams Architecture Scalability" />
      </div>
      <p>
        For scalability, the system uses Docker containers orchestrated by AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). ECS
        automates the deployment and scaling of containers, adjusting the number of instances based on traffic demands.
        The load balancer with TLS termination distributes incoming requests across these instances, enhancing fault
        tolerance and resource utilization.
      </p>
      <p>
        This combination of Go’s concurrency, Docker-based scaling, and AWS ECS automation ensures that Wynter’s Dreams
        can handle growing traffic and data demands effectively while maintaining optimal performance.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Security</h2>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="rendered/security.svg" alt="Wynter's Dreams Architecture Security" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The security of Wynter's Dreams is a top priority, with multiple layers of protection implemented to safeguard
        data and communications. All data stored in PostgreSQL and Amazon S3 is encrypted at rest, ensuring that
        sensitive information remains secure from unauthorized access. The load balancer employs TLS to encrypt all data
        in transit, protecting it from potential interception during transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, all communication between backend services occurs within a private cloud environment, further
        isolating and securing internal data exchanges. This multi-faceted approach ensures robust protection for both
        data at rest and in transit.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Deployment & Monitoring</h2>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="rendered/monitoring.svg" alt="Wynter's Dreams Architecture Monitoring" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Deployment for Wynter's Dreams is managed using AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), which facilitates automated
        scaling and orchestration of Docker containers. ECS handles the deployment of application containers, scaling
        them up or down based on real-time traffic demands, and ensures smooth and efficient management of containerized
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        For monitoring, AWS CloudWatch is employed to track and analyze logs generated by the application. CloudWatch
        provides detailed insights into system performance and operational health, enabling proactive identification and
        resolution of issues. This integration ensures that the platform remains robust and performs optimally, with
        continuous monitoring and logging to support effective management and troubleshooting.
      </p>

      <h1 class="section-heading">Implementation Details</h1>
      <h2 class="section-subheading">Challenges Faced</h2>
      <p>
        One significant challenge was devising an efficient method to index and manage book images, given that there
        isn’t a straightforward, direct flow between the images and their associated books. Initially, linking images to
        books and ensuring they were retrieved and displayed correctly posed difficulties due to the complex
        relationships and lack of a unified schema. To address this, I designed a custom indexing system where metadata
        about each image was stored alongside book data in PostgreSQL. This system included a unique identifier for each
        image, which was then used to establish a clear association between the images and their respective books.
        I also implemented a structured naming convention and organised the images in S3 with directory-like
        structures to facilitate efficient retrieval and management.
      </p>
      <p>Go model I ended up with:</p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-go">
type BookPaging struct {
	BookId string   `json:"book_id"`
	Paging []Paging `json:"paging"`
}

type Paging struct {
	Chapter    string   `json:"chapter"`
	Heading    string   `json:"heading"`
	Text       string   `json:"text"`
	Buttons    []Button `json:"buttons"`
	EndChapter bool     `json:"end_chapter"`
	Image      string   `json:"image"`
}

type Button struct {
	Text             string `json:"text"`
	NextChapter      string `json:"next_chapter"`
	NextChapterIndex int    `json:"next_chapter_index"`
}
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Integrating CCAvenue for payment processing in Go proved challenging due to the lack of direct support and
        documentation for Go. The primary difficulty was implementing the required encryption and decryption protocols
        for secure communication with CCAvenue’s API. To overcome this, I wrote custom code to handle the specific
        encryption methods mandated by CCAvenue. This involved creating encryption routines to securely transmit payment
        information and implementing decryption logic to process responses from CCAvenue.
      </p>

      <h1 class="section-heading">Testing & Deployment</h1>
      <h2 class="section-subheading">Testing Strategies</h2>
      <p>
        For testing APIs, I implemented mocking through dependency injection, which allowed for isolating the APIs from
        external services. By injecting mocked dependencies during testing, I could simulate various scenarios, ensuring
        that the APIs were thoroughly tested without relying on external systems. This approach provided a controlled
        testing environment, resulting in more reliable and efficient tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        I developed tests for database queries using sqlc in Go. These tests were designed to validate the
        correctness of SQL queries generated by sqlc, ensuring accurate data retrieval and manipulation. By focusing on
        the integrity of the database interactions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Deployment Automation</h2>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="rendered/deployment.svg" alt="Wynter's Dreams Deployment Automation">
      </div>
      <p>
        In the initial stages of deployment automation for Wynter's Dreams, I used a Makefile to streamline the process.
        The Makefile ran commands that built the backend Docker image, pushed it to AWS Elastic Container Registry
        (ECR), and then updated the deployment on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). However, to automate this process
        further, I transitioned to using GitHub Actions. This switch allowed for a more seamless, automated deployment
        pipeline directly tied to the repository, improving efficiency and removing manual intervention.
