      <h1 class="section-heading">Project Overview</h1>
      <h2 class="section-subheading">Project Name</h2>
      <p>Wynter's Dreams</p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Duration</h2>
      <p>August 2023 - March 2024</p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Role</h2>
      <p>Cloud and Backend Intern and Consultant</p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        At Emotorad, I led the design and development of a scalable backend architecture for real-time electric bike
        data ingestion, utilizing MQTT brokers and stateful Apache Flink applications for data aggregation and
        processing with Cassandra, Redis, and Kafka as sinks. I developed and maintained Go REST microservices for
        dashboards and the companion app, orchestrated deployment using AWS and Kubernetes, and managed a data lake on
        AWS S3 with queries via Presto. Additionally, I deployed Firebase cloud functions for push notifications and
        contributed to team growth by interviewing candidates for full-time and intern roles.
      </p>

      <h1 class="section-heading">Architecture & Design</h1>
      <h2 class="section-subheading">Overview</h2>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="rendered/overview.svg" alt="Emotorad Architecture Overview" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The backend architecture for Emotorad was designed with a strong focus on scalability and real-time data
        processing to handle the ingestion of electric bike data. PostgreSQL was employed to manage stateful services
        across various microservices, ensuring reliable and consistent data handling.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enhance security and access control, the system used PASETO tokens with asymmetric keys for authenticating
        multiple services. This approach ensured secure communication and robust authentication across the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Real-time data processing was a key aspect of the architecture, with stateful Apache Flink applications
        developed to perform map, reduce, and filter operations. These applications worked in tandem with Cassandra,
        Redis, and Kafka as data sinks, allowing for efficient data aggregation and processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The architecture also included Go-based REST microservices, which served as the backbone for both the Emotorad
        dashboards and the companion app. These microservices provided a seamless and responsive user experience,
        facilitating real-time interaction with the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deployment was managed using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Kubernetes, allowing for scalable and resilient
        infrastructure. This setup ensured that the system could handle varying loads and maintain high availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        To support data storage and analysis, a data lake was maintained on AWS S3, with Presto used for executing
        queries. This enabled efficient data retrieval and analysis, supporting the platform's real-time processing
        needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firebase cloud functions were deployed to manage push notifications, ensuring timely and reliable
        communication with users across the platform.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Scalability & Performance</h2>
      <p>
        Emotorad's backend architecture is designed for high performance and scalability. Built in Go, the system
        leverages Go's strong concurrency features to efficiently manage multiple requests through lightweight
        goroutines, ensuring fast and reliable processing of real-time electric bike data.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="rendered/scalability.svg" alt="Emotorad Architecture Scalability" />
      </div>
      <p>
        For scalability, the system uses Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes on Amazon EKS. The Horizontal Pod
        Autoscaler (HPA) dynamically adjusts the number of running pods based on traffic and workload, ensuring the
        system scales seamlessly with demand. The load balancer with TLS termination distributes incoming requests
        across these pods, enhancing fault tolerance and optimizing resource utilization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stateful Apache Flink jobs, for real-time data processing, are managed and scaled using the Flink
        Kubernetes Operator. This ensures that the data aggregation and processing pipelines adapt dynamically to
        varying loads, maintaining efficient and consistent performance.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-subheading">Security</h2>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="rendered/security.svg" alt="Emotorad Architecture Security" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The security of Emotorad's platform is a top priority, with multiple layers of protection in place to safeguard
        data and communications. All data stored in PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Redis, and Amazon S3 is encrypted at rest,
        ensuring that sensitive information remains secure from unauthorized access.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform employs two load balancers: one dedicated to EMQX for MQTT protocol encryption, securing the
        communication between IoT devices and the backend, and another for REST API encryption, ensuring secure data
        transmission between microservices. Both load balancers use TLS to encrypt data in transit, protecting it from
        potential interception during transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, all communication between backend services occurs within a private cloud environment on AWS,
        further isolating and securing internal data exchanges. This multi-layered security approach ensures robust
        protection for both data at rest and in transit across the entire platform.
      </p>


      <h2 class="section-subheading">Deployment & Monitoring</h2>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="rendered/monitoring.svg" alt="Emotorad Architecture Monitoring" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Deployment for Emotorad's platform is managed using AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), which facilitates
        automated scaling and orchestration of containerized microservices. EKS handles the deployment of application
        containers, scaling them up or down based on real-time traffic demands, ensuring smooth and efficient management
        of services.
      </p>
      <p>
        For logging and monitoring, MongoDB and Kafka are employed to track and analyze logs generated by the
        application. MongoDB stores the logs, while Kafka handles the streaming of log data. A WebSocket client connects
        to MongoDB, displaying real-time logs in a dashboard, providing detailed insights into system performance and
        operational health. This setup ensures that the platform remains robust, with continuous monitoring and logging
        to support effective management and troubleshooting.
      </p>


      <!--      <h1 class="section-heading">Implementation Details</h1>-->
      <!--      <h2 class="section-subheading">Challenges Faced</h2>-->
      <!--      <p>-->
      <!--        One significant challenge was devising an efficient method to index and manage book images, given that there-->
      <!--        isnâ€™t a straightforward, direct flow between the images and their associated books. Initially, linking images to-->
      <!--        books and ensuring they were retrieved and displayed correctly posed difficulties due to the complex-->
      <!--        relationships and lack of a unified schema. To address this, I designed a custom indexing system where metadata-->
      <!--        about each image was stored alongside book data in PostgreSQL. This system included a unique identifier for each-->
      <!--        image, which was then used to establish a clear association between the images and their respective books.-->
      <!--        I also implemented a structured naming convention and organised the images in S3 with directory-like-->
      <!--        structures to facilitate efficient retrieval and management.-->
      <!--      </p>-->
      <!--      <p>Go model I ended up with:</p>-->
      <!--      <pre>-->
      <!--        <code class="language-go">-->
      <!--type BookPaging struct {-->
      <!--	BookId string   `json:"book_id"`-->
      <!--	Paging []Paging `json:"paging"`-->
      <!--}-->

      <!--type Paging struct {-->
      <!--	Chapter    string   `json:"chapter"`-->
      <!--	Heading    string   `json:"heading"`-->
      <!--	Text       string   `json:"text"`-->
      <!--	Buttons    []Button `json:"buttons"`-->
      <!--	EndChapter bool     `json:"end_chapter"`-->
      <!--	Image      string   `json:"image"`-->
      <!--}-->

      <!--type Button struct {-->
      <!--	Text             string `json:"text"`-->
      <!--	NextChapter      string `json:"next_chapter"`-->
      <!--	NextChapterIndex int    `json:"next_chapter_index"`-->
      <!--}-->
      <!--        </code>-->
      <!--      </pre>-->
      <!--      <p>-->
      <!--        Integrating CCAvenue for payment processing in Go proved challenging due to the lack of direct support and-->
      <!--        documentation for Go. The primary difficulty was implementing the required encryption and decryption protocols-->
      <!--        for secure communication with CCAvenueâ€™s API. To overcome this, I wrote custom code to handle the specific-->
      <!--        encryption methods mandated by CCAvenue. This involved creating encryption routines to securely transmit payment-->
      <!--        information and implementing decryption logic to process responses from CCAvenue.-->
      <!--      </p>-->

      <!--      <h1 class="section-heading">Testing & Deployment</h1>-->
      <!--      <h2 class="section-subheading">Testing Strategies</h2>-->
      <!--      <p>-->
      <!--        For testing APIs, I implemented mocking through dependency injection, which allowed for isolating the APIs from-->
      <!--        external services. By injecting mocked dependencies during testing, I could simulate various scenarios, ensuring-->
      <!--        that the APIs were thoroughly tested without relying on external systems. This approach provided a controlled-->
      <!--        testing environment, resulting in more reliable and efficient tests.-->
      <!--      </p>-->
      <!--      <p>-->
      <!--        I developed tests for database queries using sqlc in Go. These tests were designed to validate the-->
      <!--        correctness of SQL queries generated by sqlc, ensuring accurate data retrieval and manipulation. By focusing on-->
      <!--        the integrity of the database interactions.-->
      <!--      </p>-->

      <!--      <p>-->
      <!--        In the initial stages of deployment automation for Wynter's Dreams, I used a Makefile to streamline the process.-->
      <!--        The Makefile ran commands that built the backend Docker image, pushed it to AWS Elastic Container Registry-->
      <!--        (ECR), and then updated the deployment on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). However, to automate this process-->
      <!--        further, I transitioned to using GitHub Actions. This switch allowed for a more seamless, automated deployment-->
      <!--        pipeline directly tied to the repository, improving efficiency and removing manual intervention.-->
